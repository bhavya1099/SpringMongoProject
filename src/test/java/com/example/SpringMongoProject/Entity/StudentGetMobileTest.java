ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getMobile_e15a571bc1

Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of mobile number

Details:  
  TestName: getMobileShouldReturnCorrectValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getMobile method returns the correct mobile number that has been set for the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with a known mobile number.
  Act: Invoke the getMobile method on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the known mobile number.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getMobile method correctly retrieves the value of the mobile field from the object. The expected result is significant as it confirms the method's ability to provide the correct data when called, which is a fundamental requirement for the correct functioning of the application.

Scenario 2: Mobile number is null

Details:  
  TestName: getMobileShouldHandleNull
  Description: This test verifies that the getMobile method correctly handles scenarios where the mobile number is not set (null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object without setting the mobile number (leave it null).
  Act: Invoke the getMobile method on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getMobile method can handle null values without throwing an exception. This is crucial for robustness, as the application should be able to handle cases where a mobile number might not be available for a particular object.

Scenario 3: Mobile number is an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: getMobileShouldHandleEmptyString
  Description: This test checks if the getMobile method can handle cases where the mobile number is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object and set the mobile number to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getMobile method on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the getMobile method returns an empty string when the mobile number is set to this value. This scenario is important to test because an empty string is a valid string instance and the method should handle it correctly.

Scenario 4: Mobile number with special characters

Details:  
  TestName: getMobileShouldReturnSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test ensures that the getMobile method can handle mobile numbers containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object and set the mobile number to a string with special characters.
  Act: Invoke the getMobile method on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the string with special characters.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getMobile method can retrieve mobile numbers with special characters without data loss or corruption. This is essential because mobile numbers might contain characters such as "+" or "-" in real-world scenarios, and the method should be able to handle these cases.

Scenario 5: Mobile number with leading or trailing spaces

Details:  
  TestName: getMobileShouldReturnWithSpaces
  Description: This test checks the getMobile method's ability to return a mobile number that includes leading or trailing spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object and set the mobile number to a string with leading or trailing spaces.
  Act: Invoke the getMobile method on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned value retains the leading or trailing spaces.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the getMobile method does not alter the mobile number string, including any leading or trailing spaces. Preserving the exact value is important for ensuring data integrity, as any modifications could lead to incorrect data processing or display in the application.
